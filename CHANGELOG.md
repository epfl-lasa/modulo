## 2.0.0
### August 05, 2022

Version 2.0.0 constitutes a major refactor of the Modulo project. It now provides stand-alone classes and helpers
for handling and translating messages and parameters in modulo_core, with new and improved component classes
for dynamic application composition in modulo_components.

The old concepts of Cell and Component have been fully redeveloped into modulo_components::Component and
modulo_components::LifecycleComponent, which provide a simple framework for creating stateless (unmanaged) or
state-based (managed) custom components.

For more information, see the new description of each package in the respective README.md files and view
the full generated documentation on [epfl-lasa.github.io/modulo](epfl-lasa.github.io/modulo).
